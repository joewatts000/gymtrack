# 🏋️‍♂️ GymWatch

**GymWatch** is a cross-platform fitness tracking app built with **React Native** and **Expo**.  
Users can log exercises, record sets (weight, reps, and difficulty via emoji), and view past sessions.  
Data is stored locally for quick offline access.

## 🧠 Git & Branching

**Main branch:** `main`  
All development should be done via feature branches.

```bash
git checkout -b feature/add-delete-exercise
# make your changes
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add swipe-to-delete on exercise list"
git push origin feature/add-delete-exercise
```

When ready:

- Open a **Pull Request (PR)** to `main`
- Request review
- Merge after approval

## 📱 Building for iOS

GymWatch uses **EAS Build** to create iOS builds and deploy to TestFlight or the App Store.

### 1. Log in to EAS

```bash
eas login
```

### 2. Configure project (already done)

Check your `eas.json` file:

```json
{
  "cli": {
    "version": ">= 3.0.0"
  },
  "build": {
    "development": {
      "developmentClient": true,
      "distribution": "internal"
    },
    "production": {
      "ios": {
        "distribution": "app-store"
      },
      "env": {
        "EXPO_PUBLIC_ENV": "production"
      }
    }
  },
  "submit": {
    "production": {}
  }
}
```

### 3. Build a new iOS release

```bash
eas build -p ios --profile production
```

EAS will:

- Bundle your app  
- Upload to Expo’s build servers  
- Produce an `.ipa` ready for submission  

---

## 🚢 Submitting to TestFlight

After your build finishes:

```bash
eas submit -p ios --latest
```

This uploads the latest `.ipa` to **App Store Connect** for **TestFlight** distribution.

Then go to:
👉 [https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/apps](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/apps)

- Open your app  
- Go to the **TestFlight** tab  
- Add internal or external testers  
- Wait for Apple’s processing (takes 10–20 min)

---

## 🔁 Releasing a New Version

Every time you want to push a new TestFlight or App Store build:

1. **Increment version & build number** in `app.json`:

   ```json
   {
     "expo": {
       "version": "0.1.2",
       "ios": {
         "buildNumber": "2"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   - `version` = user-visible version (`0.1.2`)
   - `buildNumber` = internal counter (must increase every submission)

2. **Run the build again**

   ```bash
   eas build -p ios --profile production
   ```

3. **Submit to TestFlight**

   ```bash
   eas submit -p ios --latest
   ```

4. **(Optional)** Submit to **App Store**
   - Log into [App Store Connect](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/)
   - Go to **App Store → Prepare for Submission**
   - Add screenshots, description, and select the latest build
   - Click **Submit for Review**
